Creates a 2000 x 2000 image with 25 bunnies.

We ran our code on 255x12. For some reason it would not run on all machines.
We got a "too many resources requested for launch" error on Tesla and most
of the lab machines. It worked on 255x12 though.

The final picture from the GPU had a few specs because we did not implement
mutexes.
